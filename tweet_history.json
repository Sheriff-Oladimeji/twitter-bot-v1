They give holders a say in decision-making processes, such as proposing new features or setting priorities for a decentralized project. \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\n\nIn Web3, governance tokens are used to make decisions on the direction of a decentralized application (dApp) or protocol. They're often used in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, where token holders can vote on changes to the protocol's rules or parameters. \ud83d\udcc8\n\nFor example, in the MakerDAO protocol, MKR token holders can vote on changes to the protocol's interest rates or collateral requirements. This way, the community has a say in how the protocol operates and can adapt to changing market conditions. \ud83c\udf10\n\nGovernance tokens are a key aspect of decentralized decision-making and help ensure that projects are developed in a way that benefits the community as a whole. \ud83d\udca1",
